# Decision Support System for diagnosising gold strategy for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Categorization

# Abstract
Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an important tool in all fields, especially the medical field. AI is accepted around the world and is used to design medical applications that help healthcare professionals diagnose patients. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease that makes breathing difficult because the airways are narrower than normal and can lead to respiratory failure. The mortality rate from COPD is increasing and COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide. In this study, we will discuss the need for a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for COPD to help healthcare professionals establish effective diagnostic and treatment protocols. In addition, we designed CDSS for COPD using techniques such as Support Vector Machine, Neural Network and Decision Tree methods.
